## What Does it Mean to do a Startup
1. Team
  - how committed is the team?
2. Growth
3. Vision
4. Market Need


### Team
Everything here is rough rules of thumb.
- founders
  + students (Research Lead)
  + students (Research Team)
  + Students (MBA)
  + Professors (?)
- how to split up the pot
  + 10-15% for angels (don't let them have more)
  + founders more than majority stake (70 - 80%)
  + advisory board (2-5%)
  + option pool (10-15%)


- Angels
  + equity (10-15%)
  + Convertible Note
    * don't know how much I'm worth, but when one figures it out, I get a d%
      discount: Money: `d`, Discount: `d%`, and Cap: `c`
    * put max cap high (between 2 and 10 M)
    * investor gets `(1 + d) * x * c`
  - YC Note (SAFE)
  - sometimes note has a cap, safes don't

- Professor (Consulting)
  + Student and Professor lead (small %)
  + Well-wisher (few %)
  + detailed support (interim CEO)

- University
  + Patents
  + NYU can't claim ownership of class projects

- allocate ~20 Million shares worth about $2 or $20 in total
