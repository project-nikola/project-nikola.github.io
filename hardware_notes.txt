Envionmental sensor:

Xbee series 2 - AT MODE
-I don't know why it doesn't work in API mode, but I can't serial communication over DIN/DOUT using API mode.

-uses same config as Kill-a-Watt xbee's. 

-AD0 is used for photoresistor
-DIN is used for arduino communication

-BMP180 and DHT22 sensors are attached to the arduino.

PIN 2 - DHT22 sensor
PIN A4 and A5 - BMP180

TX (arduino) -> DIN (xbee)
RX (arduino) -> DOUT (xbee)

SETUP:
-include pic
-Arduino

NEED TO DO:

-figure out why it can't work in API mode
-figure out a way to provide the board 3.3V (DC) from a wall outlet (110V AC)
-design a new schematic and layout
-place onto proto-board
-manufacture a small batch of PCB boards
