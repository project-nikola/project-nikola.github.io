This is the website for our energy sensing and automation project for Professor
Lakshminarayanan Subramanian's
[Extreme Design](http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/fall14/CSCI-GA.3033-008/) course at
NYU. This class started September 2nd, 2014 and will end in late December.
Adam Jackrel, Bob Gardner, and Daniel Basner are the *talented* and *humble*
developers working on this.
